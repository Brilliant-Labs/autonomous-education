# Autonomous Education

This framework provides tools for learning any technology. This is possible because the learning process is essentially guided by a feedback loop that is the same regardless of the technology. The initial action is referred to as the [kickstart](documents/kickstart) because it gets the feedback loop started. After the initial input, the system/technology will produce some form of feedback. This feedback is often an error. The feedback can then be researched, and influence the next iteration.  
  
This framework was designed with a few features in mind. Firstly, there are no assumptions about which technologies a user may be learning. This protects the system from obsolescence, because over time even though technologies may come and go, the learning process does not change significantly from year to year.

 ### "uhh, cool. Where do I start?"
